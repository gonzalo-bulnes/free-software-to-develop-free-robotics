%% Free Software to Develop Free Robotics
%
% This talk is intended to give people the wish to use free software and
% hardware to share knowledge about and learn robotics, create robots, and
% make money from their work in order to build a strong free hardware community.
%
% It was initially presented at the 4th Robots Chile meetup in Santiago, Chile,
% on april 16, 2012.
% Its contents are released under the GNU Free Documentation License, and its
