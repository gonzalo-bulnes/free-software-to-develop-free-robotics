Free Software to Develop Free Robotics
======================================

## Abstract

This two-part twenty-minute talk introduces a free robotics development stack composed by Ubuntu, ROS and the Arduino IDE. ([PDF in English](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/free-software-to-develop-free-robotics/raw/master/FLOSH.pdf) and [PDF in Spanish](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/free-software-to-develop-free-robotics/raw/master/FLOSH-es.pdf))

The first part contains no technical information. It introduces free software and hardware licenses, explains how they incentive collaborative work and innovation, and, beyond that, how their use can lead to an evolution in the perception companies have of the value of their developers and products, with significant effects on the adoption of modern working methods (agile and value-driven development) and environements (intrinsic motivation).

The second part provides a ROS, Arduino and Android demonstration system to promote free robotics development tools as accessible and state-of-the-art tools to learn robotics, to develop them professionally, and to contribute to the emergence of a sustainable free (as in free speech) hardware community.
It is closely related to the [Driving an Arduino Board LED from an Android Device] [1] ROS tutorial which was written to describe the system in detail.
